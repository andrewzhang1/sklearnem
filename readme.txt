This repo contains examples of running some examples of scikit-learn:

- Naive Bayes (works best)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- GBRT (works worst)

The use-case is: Predict S&P 500 for 2015 from data between 1987 and 2014.

To run these demos you should install Anaconda Python on Mac or Linux.

Then run shell script:

./runem.bash
